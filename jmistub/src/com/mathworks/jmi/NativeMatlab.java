 * A partial stubbed out implementation of the NativeMatlab class with the method's used by matlabcontrol. This stub
 * exists so that matlabcontrol can compile against this library. At runtime this library is not referenced, instead the
 * jmi.jar on MATLAB's classpath is used. The build script for matlabcontrol intentionally does not include this
 * library in the distribution folder it generates.
