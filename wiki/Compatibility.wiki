#summary Known compatibility for operating systems and versions of MATLAB

= Known Compatibility =

Below is a chart of known compatibility for version 3.1.0 when running outside MATLAB:

||              || `R2011a` || `R2010b` ||`R2010a`||`R2009b`||`R2009a`||`R2008b`||`R2008a`||`R2007b`||
|| OS X 10.5    || ? ||    Yes   ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||   No^†^  || No^†^  || No^†^  || No^†^  ||
|| OS X 10.6    || ? ||    ?   ||    Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||
|| Windows XP   || ? ||   `*`   ||    Yes  ||   Yes  ||    Yes   ||   Yes  ||    Yes   ||   Yes  ||
|| Windows Vista|| ? ||    `*`   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||
|| Windows 7    ||  `*` ||   `*`   ||    `*`  ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    Yes   ||

*?* No reports. If you have this configuration please leave a comment with the relevant data and the table will be updated.

*`*`* Yes for some, No for others. The reason for this is not understood. If matlabcontrol does not work for you with this setup, any information you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

*^†^* matlabcontrol requires Java 6. OS X versions of MATLAB R2009a and earlier are 32-bit only. Apple only released 64-bit Java 6 for OS X 10.5. There are unofficial ways to run 32-bit Java on OS X 10.5.


----

There are reports of recent Windows versions of MATLAB (`R2010a` through `R2011a`) sometimes hanging indefinitely when launched by matlabcontrol. Attempts are being made to resolve this issue in a future release.

Due to the large diversity of Linux distributions, Linux is not shown in the above table. However, the following combinations are known to work:
Debian 2.6 & `R2008b`, Ubuntu 9.10 & `R2010a`, unknown Linux distro & `R2011a`

*No effort will be made to ensure compatibility with versions prior to `R2007b`.* This is because versions of MATLAB prior to `R2007b` [http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-1812J/ do not make use of Java 6].
