#summary Known compatibility for operating systems and versions of MATLAB

= Known Compatibility =

Below is a chart of known compatibility:

||              || `R2010b` ||`R2010a`||`R2009b`||`R2009a`||`R2008b`||`R2008a`||`R2007b`||`R2007a`||

It is strongly suspected that matlabcontrol will work for all of the configurations in the above table; however, only the cells marked with `Yes` have been confirmed. Older versions of MATLAB have also been known to work but are not shown in the above table. *No effort is (or will be) made to ensure compatibility with versions prior to `R2007a`.*

Due to the large diversity of Linux distributions, Linux is not shown in the above table. However, the following combinations are known to work:
Debian 2.6 & `R2008b`, Ubuntu 9.10 & `R2010a` 

*If your configuration has a question mark (?) in its cell, please leave a comment with the relevant data and the table will be updated.*
