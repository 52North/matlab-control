#summary Known compatibility for operating systems and versions of MATLAB

= Known Compatibility =

Below is a chart of known compatibility for version 3.1.0 when running outside MATLAB:

||              || `R2011a` || `R2010b` ||`R2010a`||`R2009b`||`R2009a`||`R2008b`||`R2008a`||`R2007b`||
|| OS X 10.5    || ? ||    Yes   ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||  ? || Yes || Yes || ? ||
|| OS X 10.6    || ? ||    ?   ||    Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||
|| Windows XP   || ? ||   `*`   ||    Yes  ||   Yes  ||    Yes   ||   Yes  ||    Yes   ||   Yes  ||
|| Windows Vista|| ? ||    `*`   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||
|| Windows 7    ||  `*` ||   `*`   ||    `*`  ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    Yes   ||

*No effort will be made to ensure compatibility with versions prior to `R2007b`.*

*?* No reports. If you have this configuration please leave a comment with the relevant data and the table will be updated.

*`*`* Yes for some, no for others. If matlabcontrol does not work for you with this setup, any information you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Due to the large diversity of Linux distributions, Linux is not shown in the above table. However, the following combinations are known to work:
Debian 2.6 & `R2008b`, Ubuntu 9.10 & `R2010a`, unknown Linux distro & `R2011a`

If when matlabcontrol launches MATLAB, MATLAB displays the error <font color="red">`??? Undefined variable "matlabcontrol" or class "matlabcontrol.MatlabConnector.connectFromMatlab"`</font> this is most likely because your version of MATLAB is using a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is too old to be compatible with matlabcontrol. matlabcontrol 3.1.0 makes use of Java 5, which is Java Class Version 49. To check which Java Class Version your MATLAB JVM supports, in MATLAB enter `java.lang.System.getProperty('java.class.version')`. If it is less than 49, you must either upgrade to a newer version of MATLAB (which uses a newer JVM) or upgrade your MATLAB's JVM. [http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-1812J/ More information] is available from The MathWorks on which JVM your version of MATLAB is using and how to upgrade the JVM. By default, all of the versions of MATLAB in the above table use a compatible JVM.
