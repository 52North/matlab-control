#summary Known compatibility for operating systems and versions of MATLAB

= Known Compatibility =

Below is a chart of known compatibility:

||              || `R2010b` ||`R2010a`||`R2009b`||`R2009a`||`R2008b`||`R2008a`||`R2007b`||`R2007a`||
|| OS X 10.5    ||    Yes   ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||   Yes  ||    ?   ||    ?   ||    ?   ||

Some issue with `R2010b` have been reported. `R2010b` can take longer to initialize which means that the default timeout of 60 seconds for connecting the proxy smay not be enough. If proxy timeout is encountered with `R2010b` please use the `RemoteMatlabProxyFactory.getProxy(long timeout)` method and specify a longer timeout. If other problems with `R2010b` are encountered please communicate them via the survey.

It is strongly suspected that matlabcontrol will work for `R2007a` to `R2010a` on all of the above operating systems; however, only the cells marked with `Yes` have been confirmed. Older versions of MATLAB have also been known to work but are not shown in the above table. *No effort is (or will be) made to ensure compatibility with versions prior to `R2007a`.*

Due to the large diversity of Linux distributions, Linux is not shown in the above table. However, the following combinations are known to work:
Debian 2.6 & `R2008b`, Ubuntu 9.10 & `R2010a` 

*If your configuration has a question mark (?) in its cell, please leave a comment with the relevant data and the table will be updated.*
