#summary Java MATLAB Interface (JMI) allows Java to interact with MATLAB

= Introduction =

The code available on this website relies upon the Java MATLAB Interface. This interface is entirely undocumented and not publicly acknowledged by The Mathworks.

= What is the interface code? =

This interface comes in the form of a jar file called jmi.jar with MATLAB. It is found at /java/jar/jmi.jar in the MATLAB directory on your computer. For instance, on OS X with `MATLAB R2009b` it is located at /Applications/MATLAB_R20009b.app/java/jar/jmi.jar.


= History =
JMI has been distributed with each version of MATLAB since at least MATLAB 6.1 (`R12.1`) and possibly as far back as MATLAB 6.0 (`R12`) when Java was first integrated into MATLAB. In February of 2002 Peter Webb published an article entitled "Integrating Java Components into MATLAB" in the News and Notes section of the Newsletters published by The Mathworks. Additionally, he posted the code used in his article on the website. The article has since been removed for the website, the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/news_notes/win02/patterns.html">page</a> has been removed. However, a copy of the article is <a href="http://bbs.matwav.com/viewthread.php?tid=71482">available on zfhit's blog</a>. The <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/nnimagebrowser">page with the code</a> states that "The file you are trying to view is not in a published state." I am unaware of any existing mirrors of this example code. The Mathworks has never since posted any information regarding JMI, although a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/search_results?dur=all&page=1&search_string=tag%3Ajmi">few posts
</a> relating to JMI are available on MATLAB Central which is part of The Mathworks website.
