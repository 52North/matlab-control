#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= Introduction =

Below are questions that I have frequently been asked via email or the questionnaire. If you have a question not answered here, leave it in the comments.


* Is there a tutorial / walkthrough of how to use matlabcontrol? *

No. A tutorial will be posted at the same time that the next version comes out (late May / early June).

* Is the source code for the demo available? *

No. When the next version comes out (late May / early June) a new demo will also be released. The source code for that demo will be available.

* I'm trying to do {your project here}, is matlabcontrol what I am looking for? *

Maybe. You should check out ApproachesToControl to see lots of related projects. matlabcontrol was originally created to allow for programmatic control of the MATLAB GUI; however, it can also be used for doing computation in MATLAB and retrieving the results in Java. If doing computation in MATLAB is your primary goal then you should consider the officially supported [http://www.mathworks.com/products/javabuilder/ MATLAB Builder JA] created by The MathWorks.

* The methods that call into MATLAB have a return type of `Object`, what are they actually returning? *

The reason the return type is `Object` is because MATLAB can return anything. For instance the expression "sqrt(5)" will return array of `double`s, "pwd" will return a `java.lang.String`, and "whos" will return a complicated array of arrays with a variety of base types and `Object`s in it. The above is what occurs in MATLAB `R2009b`, but not necessarily in past or future versions. You will have to experiment to find out what you is being returned. The demo can help as it lists everything returned, including what is inside of arrays.

* Why was matlabcontrol created? *

It was created to allow for grading program written in Java used by Teaching Assistants to programmatically control MATLAB in order to open, run, and close students' MATLAB code assignments.

* When controlling a remote session can I have it control an already open instance of MATLAB? *

No, and there are no plans to add this functionality as it would dramatically increase the complexity of successfully connecting to a remote session. However, the code is open source so feel free to modify it to do so.

* Can the Java program and MATLAB be on separate computers on the same network? *

No, and there are no plans to add this functionality. However, the code is open source so feel free to modify it to do so.
