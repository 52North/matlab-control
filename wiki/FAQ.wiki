Below are questions that I have frequently been asked via email or as comments to this page. If you have a question not answered here, please either email me or comment on this page.

<font color="red">*The following refers to an unreleased version, 4.0.0</font>

* Is there a tutorial / walkthrough of how to use matlabcontrol? *

Yes, it can be found [http://code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/wiki/Walkthrough here].

* Is the source code for the demo available? *

Yes. The source code can be downloaded under the Downloads tab; this contains both the source for the library and demo. The source code can also be viewed without downloading it by using the Source tab. The demo is not intended to be an example of how to use matlabcontrol, but instead an interactive demonstration of its capabilities. See the [Walkthrough walkthrough] for examples.

* I'm trying to do {your project here}, is matlabcontrol what I am looking for? *

Maybe. You should check out ApproachesToControl to see lots of related projects. matlabcontrol was originally created to allow for programmatic control of the MATLAB GUI; however, it can also be used for doing computation in MATLAB and retrieving the results in Java. If doing computation in MATLAB is your primary goal then you should consider the officially supported [http://www.mathworks.com/products/javabuilder/ MATLAB Builder JA] created by The MathWorks.

* The methods that call into MATLAB have a return type of `Object` or `Object[]`, what are they actually returning? *

They can return anything, it depends on how you are using the methods. The javadocs for `matlabcontrol.MatlabProxy` detail how MATLAB types are converted to Java types. Additionally, you may make use of `matlabcontrol.extensions.MatlabProxyLogger` to see a detailed breakdown of what is being returned from MATLAB, including what is inside of arrays.

* When running outside MATLAB can I have it control an already running session of MATLAB? *

Yes, if the session was previously launched by matlabcontrol and is not currently being controlled by any other external Java applications. The feature is off by default, it can be enabled by use of the `matlabcontrol.MatlabProxyFactoryOptions`.

* Is matlabcontrol thread-safe?* 

Yes, it is almost entirely unconditionally thread-safe. However, MATLAB itself is single-threaded so if you are performing concurrent calls on a `matlabcontrol.MatlabProxy` expect a lot of blocking. The one exception to thread-safety in matlabcontrol is when inside of a `MatlabThreadCallable` passed to `matlabcontrol.MatlabProxy`'s `invokeAndWait(...)` method. See the documentation for details.

* Can the Java program and MATLAB be on separate computers on the same network? *

No, and there are no plans to add this functionality. However, the code is open source so feel free to modify it to do so. Be aware that matlabcontrol is specifically designed to operate using localhost-only sockets.

* Why was matlabcontrol created? *

It was created to allow for a grading program written in Java used by teaching assistants to programmatically control MATLAB in order to open, run, and close students' MATLAB code assignments. matlabcontrol now has functionality that far exceeds the needs of the grading program.

The following refers to matlabcontrol 3.1.0.

* The methods that call into MATLAB have a return type of `Object`, what are they actually returning? *

The reason the return type is `Object` is because MATLAB can return anything. For instance the expression "sqrt(5)" will return an array of `double`s, "pwd" will return a `java.lang.String`, and "whos" will return a complicated array of arrays with a variety of base types and `Object`s in it. The above is what occurs in MATLAB `R2009b`, but not necessarily in past or future versions. You will have to experiment to find out what is being returned. The demo can help as it lists everything returned, including what is inside of arrays.

* When controlling a local session sometimes MATLAB hangs indefinitely, why? *

This can occur if you are calling from the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) used by AWT/Swing components. The EDT is used extensively by MATLAB when accessing graphical components such as a figure window, uicontrols or plots. When you call into matlabcontrol it pauses the thread you are calling from until MATLAB is done with your request. However, if MATLAB is trying to use the EDT and you called from the EDT it will be unable to complete the request as the EDT is paused. To avoid this you will have to call matlabcontrol from a different thread. An easy way to call from a different thread is to make use of a [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newSingleThreadExecutor%28%29 single thread executor].

* When controlling a remote session can I have it control an already open instance of MATLAB? *

No. This functionality is planned for a future release.

* Can the Java program and MATLAB be on separate computers on the same network? *

No, and there are no plans to add this functionality. However, the code is open source so feel free to modify it to do so.
