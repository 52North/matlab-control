#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= Introduction =

Below are questions that I have frequently been asked via email or the questionnaire. If you have a question not answered here, leave it in the comments.


* Is there a tutorial / walkthrough of how to use matlabcontrol? *

No. A tutorial will be posted at the same time that the next version comes out (late May / early June).

* Is the source code for the demo available? *

No. When the next version comes out (late May / early June) a new demo will also be released. The source code for that demo will be available.

* I'm trying to do {your project here}, is matlabcontrol what I am looking for? *

Maybe. You should check out ApproachesToControl to see lots of related projects. matlabcontrol was originally created to allow for programmatic control of the MATLAB GUI; however, it can also be used for doing computation in Matlab and retrieving the results in Java. If doing computation in Matlab is your primary goal then you should consider the officially supported [http://www.mathworks.com/products/javabuilder/ MATLAB Builder JA] created by The MathWorks.
