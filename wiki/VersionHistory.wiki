#summary Information on the releases of matlabcontrol

= Version History =

New versions of matlabcontrol are released periodically. The capabilities and reliability of matlabcontrol have improved as underlying [JMI Java MATLAB Interface] has become better understood.

== Versioning Format ==

Versions use a `α.β.γ` format to indicate information about the release. `α` indicates a major new release which is incompatible with releases with a different `α`. `β` introduces new or improved features while retaining full binary compatibility. For example an application making use of 1.3.2 could upgrade to 1.4.0 without changing their code. `γ` is a bug fix and retains full binary compatibility. For instance an application could upgrade from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 without changing their code.

== Releases == 

===4.0.0===
_Not yet released. The following information is subject to change._

A major overhaul of matlabcontrol, it includes the following:
  * Dramatically improved reliability, with a complete rewrite of the MATLAB interaction logic
  * Transparent unification of control from inside MATLAB and outside MATLAB
  * Unconditionally thread-safe
  * Highly configurable MATLAB settings, including running hidden
  * Ability to reconnect to a previously controlled session
  * Can disconnect from a MATLAB session without exiting MATLAB
  * Detailed documentation which includes how types are converted between MATLAB and Java
  * Numeric array conversion between MATLAB and Java arrays
  * Non-interference with any other Remote Method Invocation uses in the application (when running outside MATLAB)
  * Transfer non-JRE classes between MATLAB and the Java application (when running outside MATLAB)
  * Fixes bugs preventing a Java application from terminating properly (when running outside MATLAB)

===3.1.0===
Improves reliability and documentation. Fixes issue with incorrectly determining matlabcontrol's location when loaded by custom class loaders.

===3.0.1===
Fixes issues with Windows paths being determined incorrectly.

===3.0.0===
Introduces ability to control MATLAB from inside MATLAB. Package renamed from `matlab` to `matlabcontrol`. Adds Windows compatibility.

===2.0.0===
First public release. Added improved documentation. Interaction with MATLAB now essentially a refactored version of Kamin Whitehouse's MatlabControl.

===1.0.0===
The initial proof of concept. This version was never publicly released. It was essentially a thin Remote Method Invocation (RMI) wrapper around [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~whitehouse/matlab/JavaMatlab.html Kamin Whitehouse's MatlabControl class].
