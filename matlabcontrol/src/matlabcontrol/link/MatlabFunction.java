     * <li><b>Valid MATLAB function name</b><br/>
     *     The value will be treated as a function on MATLAB's path. Whether a function with the specified name is
     *     actually on MATLAB's path will not be confirmed.</li>
     * <li><b>Absolute path to an m-file</b><br/>
     *     The value will be treated as the location of an m-file. The file's existence will be confirmed.</li>
     * <li><b>Relative path to an m-file</b><br/>
     *     The value will be treated as the location of an m-file relative to the root directory of the interface which
     *     declared the method being annotated. For example if the interface is {@code com.example.MyInterface} located
     *     at {@code /projects/code/numera/com/example/MyInterface.java} then path will be resolved relative to
     *     {@code /projects/code/numera/}. This path can be resolved properly when both the interface and m-file are
     *     inside of a zip file such as a jar or war file. The file's existence will be confirmed.</li>
     * </ol>
     * The validity of this element's value will be determined when the interface containing the method being annotated
     * is provided to {@link MatlabFunctionLinker#link(java.lang.Class, matlabcontrol.MatlabProxy)}.
